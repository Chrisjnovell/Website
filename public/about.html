      Hello there! I'm Chris and I code stuff!<br>
      In September I'll be in my third year of studying Computer Science at
      the University of Portsmouth, I'm looking into the software development/ engineering
      job roles and thought making a little portfolio would help me out.<br>
      I'm quite new to using Github as a repository base but feel free to browse my profile and projects:

    </p>

      I have been coding since studying Computer Science at GCSE level, so around 7 years now.
      All through GCSE and A-Levels, I only used vb.net and didn't really branch out but once I went
      to uni I learned Python, Java, a bunch of web stuff including HTML, CSS, and JS.
      I have also used Haskell, MATLAB, Lua, mySQL, and a few others, but not enough to be
      confident using them again straight away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy playing badminton with my friends and I'm the Events/ Rag sec for Badminton in 2020/2021.
      So far I have organised a charity run for the NHS, .<br>
      I'm also a speedcuber which means I've competed in solving the Rubik's cube in as fast
      a time as possible. I've competed in three different events:
      <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
        <li>Crawley Competition 2018</li>
        <li>London Open 2017</li>
        <li>Guildford Open 2016</li>
      </ul>
      I'm currently learning a few languages (not coding ones) which are Spanish and Tee-line Shorthand,
      both of which I've found to be really interesting.<br>
