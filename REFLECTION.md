#Reflection of project
Reflection of website portfolio

At the beginning of a project it is always hard to start and find your bearings. I began by deciding to store my code using Github (which I haven't used in about a year), have atom.io as my text editor, and also I decided I wanted to use a server to host my website using git and node. Fun stuff!

I created a Github repo and learned there was a way to commit changes directly in atom to Github so I decided to give that a go. To test this I made a test.py file (a mistake as the repo now presumed im making a python project :P, I fixed this using a .gitattributes file) and committed it and pushed it to Github. Then I went over to Github to see if it had changed and it had. Nice!

Next I created a few files: a HTML file, a CSS file, and a JS file. I filled these out with some basic beginning code, then went to start the server and it wouldn't get the files at localhost:8080. I tried a couple of things to troubleshoot this but found out later on that I don't need to commit the changes for the server to host the page (soz if you're browsing my commit log) and eventually got it to work. It turns out I was missing an important app.use line whoops.

I then decided to reorganise my project by creating some folders for images and for the HTML and CSS files I will be using. I also downloaded a filler image to use on my home screen. Next I fiddled around with the HTML and CSS to make my homepage look nicer. I realised from doing this that I need to do a lot more research into using better HTML and CSS as I am currently going off of what I could remember form a couple years ago.
